       "\"this topic is a little bit controversial it might potentially upset certain people because they had this certain thought that the mother inside the apple cider vinegar really was the same thing as the sediment at the bottom of the container so let's discuss this topic when you start out with apples and you go to alcohol you need a certain type of yeast this is the first step of fermentation there's also a second step of fermentation where you go from alcohol to vinegar when we're talking about opposite of vinegar we're talking about acetic acid as the type of vinegar and that uses a a very specific type of bacteria and when we talk about this thing called the mother okay um we're really talking about a combination of two things friendly bacteria and number two very specific enzymes like cellulase hemicellulase and pectinase and there's other as well the true mother is really bacteria and enzymes now I have a question for you can you see an enzyme when's the last time you actually saw an enzyme they're invisible what about a bacteria can you actually see bacteria chances are no so the True Mother bacteria and enzymes cannot be seen when you see the sediment at the bottom of the container what you're looking at is kind of something left over from this fermentation process and so the only thing you can really tell about this sediment is it's completely unfiltered it does not mean that there's enzymes or probiotics in that sediment when you heat appleid of vinegar pasteurize it you kill the bacteria and the enzymes when you use high pressure you can also kill bacteria and enzymes so you could potentially have a product with that sediment on the bottom of the container and have no true mother just particles of these apples or the some of the fiber that was left now in the United States there's over 50 different organic apple cider vinegar Brands which are supplied by three main companies now one of the most popular brands brag was started by Patricia brag who unfortunately passed away this year 2023 at the age of 94 but she sold her company in 2020 when she retired to a private equ firm now what many people don't know about brags is that they were a marketing company they never supplied or produced their own product in fact from the Year 2006 to 2021 most of their upset of vegar was from another company called fairchilds which by the way is the only brand that produces and sells their product all these other brands are like private labeling from three companies but fair trials no longer supplies brag now I don't get any Financial kickbacks from fairchilds when I see a product that's high quality I like to promote it and the challenge with a truly high quality organic raw apple cider vinegar is that it's much more difficult in creating wine actually because you can't make it with hybd yeast cultures you can't use uh nitrogens you can't use phosphates you can't use sulfur dioxide and you can't use pasteurization like wine is pasteurized from my research uh fairchild's is the best on the market and the thing about fairchilds is that they don't dilute it it's undiluted unfiltered it's raw it's organic the acidity level is like 6.3 which is 25% stronger than brag because unfortunately brags now adds water to the product and dilutes it anyway I wanted to clear up this confusion on what this actual True Mother really is and it's not just sediment it's something that's invisible and to really know that a product has this mother in it you really have to know um the source and the manufacturing process of the company now because of the censoring and the suppressing of the algorithms on YouTube it's becoming more difficult to find my content and there's a lot of content that I cannot put on YouTube unfortunately so to make sure you have full access of all my information go to drberg.com And subscribe to my newsletter by clicking the link Down Below in the description I will see you on the other side now if you have not seen my very popular video on the benefits of appside vinegar I put it up right here check it out\""
